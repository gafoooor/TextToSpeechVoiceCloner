# Real-Time Voice Cloning Toolbox

### Overview

This Real-Time Voice Cloning Toolbox allows users to easily clone voices from audio samples using state-of-the-art **deep learning models** such as **Tacotron 2** and **WaveNet**. The toolbox supports **multi-language voice cloning**, offering users the ability to control **emotion** and **intonation** to produce expressive and natural-sounding synthetic speech.

### Features

- **Voice Cloning** from audio samples in real time.
- Utilizes **Tacotron 2** and **WaveNet** models for high-quality voice synthesis.
- **Speaker database** with diverse voice samples for preview and selection.
- **Upload your own voice samples** for cloning.
- Support for **multiple languages** and accents.
- Fine-grained control over **emotion** and **intonation** in the cloned voices.
- **Real-time playback** of cloned voices and exportable **audio output** for various applications.

### Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Tacotron 2** - for text-to-speech synthesis.
- **WaveNet** - for generating high-fidelity, natural-sounding speech.
- **NumPy**, **SciPy**, and **Librosa** - for signal processing and audio manipulation.
- **PyTorch** - for model training and inference.

### Usage

- **Start the application:**

   ```bash
   python voicecloner.py

- Select a speaker from the provided database or upload your own voice sample.

- Enter the text you want to convert into speech and fine-tune the emotion and intonation controls for natural voice synthesis.

- Preview the cloned voice in real-time and export the audio if satisfied.

### Example Output

The application will provide real-time feedback on the cloned voice with the following options:

- Text-to-voice synthesis with natural emotion and intonation.
- Instant playback of the generated voice.
- Option to export the final audio output for use in other applications.
